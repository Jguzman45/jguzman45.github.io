1- The first step is that the browser contacts the DNS, after the browser has the IP address it intiates a connection with the github server. Once the "pipe" has been secured, the browser will send a formal HTTP get request. Then the request travels through routers and swithces, like from the wifi to the ISP and Github data center. Then Github will receives the request at a loader balancer and reverse proxy then github will send back the HTTP response. Finally the browser will receive the HTML and display the website
2- GitHub pages are a static hosting server that serves HTML, CSS, and js file directly from the browser without any side server processing. While a docker container is a lightweight standalone package that includes everything that is needed to run a piece of software, including code, runtime, system tools and libraries. While GitHub pages is limited to front end files, dockers meanwhile allow for complex dynamic enviroments that can run back end languages and databases
3- I used AI to help me with the image part of the project and the table too, I asked AI "How do I insert an image for my website" and "Show a sample code to create the table". I saw the errors like some of the placeholder names being leftover which I had to delete and run again to make sure that the website is running and doesn't have any errors. I was very lost with setting up the website and I asked AI to show me some videos that show github basics and I am getting the hang of this albeit with the help of AI
